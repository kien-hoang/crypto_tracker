# Crypto Tracker application

I'm Bradley. I'm learning MVVM + Combine + SwiftUI.

I'm following the tutorial on @SwiftfulThinking Youtube and storing source code in this repository.

The complete tutorial is available for free on his YouTube channel @SwiftfulThinking. The project uses MVVM Architecture, CoreData and Combine. Live cryptocurrency data is downloaded from CoinGecko API.
